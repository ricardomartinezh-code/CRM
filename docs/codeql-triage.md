# CodeQL Code Scanning Triage

Follow these steps to review and triage CodeQL alerts generated by the automated workflow:

1. Navigate to the repository on GitHub and open the **Security** tab.
2. Select **Code scanning** from the left-hand menu to view all CodeQL alerts.
3. For each alert:
   - Review the description and the affected file and line to understand the issue.
   - Use the **Show more** link to read CodeQL's reasoning and recommended fix.
   - Confirm whether the alert is valid, a false positive, or already addressed.
4. If the alert is valid:
   - Create or update an issue/PR describing the remediation plan.
   - Link the alert to the tracking issue using the **Link to an issue** option.
   - Prioritize and assign the task according to severity.
5. If the alert is a false positive or an acceptable risk:
   - Dismiss the alert in GitHub, selecting the appropriate reason (e.g., _won't fix_ or _used in tests_).
   - Document the rationale in the dismissal comment for future reference.
6. Review the triage board regularly to ensure open alerts are progressing toward resolution.

Document any noteworthy decisions or recurring patterns in team documentation to improve future triage sessions.
